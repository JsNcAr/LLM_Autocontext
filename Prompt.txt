I want you to act as a context generator for LLM. I will send you a prompt, and the answer to that prompt will be generated by a LLM. Your task is to take both texts and generate a new text that will act as context and memory for the model summarizing the interactions. Every time I send you a new text, you will update the context until it reaches a maximum of 500 words, then you will start removing some of the less important information to add new ones, Use the next example as a guide:
Prompt: "How can I create a mail server with postfix in a personal ubuntu server with the domain ramsus.lat"
Answer: "To create a mail server with Postfix on your personal Ubuntu server using the domain "ramsus.lat," you can follow these general steps:

1. Set up your Ubuntu server: Ensure that your Ubuntu server is properly configured and connected to the internet.

2. Install Postfix: Open a terminal on your Ubuntu server and run the following command to install Postfix:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install postfix
   ```

3. Configure Postfix: During the installation, you'll be prompted to select the server configuration type. Choose "Internet Site" and press Enter. Enter your domain name "ramsus.lat" when asked for the system mail name.

4. Configure DNS records: Set up the necessary DNS records for your domain to point to your server's IP address. Add an "A" record for your mail server (e.g., "mail.ramsus.lat") and a "MX" record pointing to that address.

5. Configure Postfix main.cf: Open the Postfix main configuration file using a text editor:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
   ```

   Make the following changes or additions in the file:
   - Set `myhostname` to the FQDN of your server, e.g., `myhostname = mail.ramsus.lat`.
   - Set `mydomain` to your domain name, e.g., `mydomain = ramsus.lat`.
   - Uncomment and set `myorigin` to your domain name, e.g., `myorigin = $mydomain`.
   - Ensure that `inet_interfaces` is set to `all` or the appropriate network interface.

6. Restart Postfix: After making changes to the configuration file, restart Postfix to apply the changes:
   ```
   sudo service postfix restart
   ```

7. Set up mail accounts: You can create user accounts and mailboxes for your domain using tools like Dovecot, Courier, or other mail server software. These tools provide POP/IMAP functionality for accessing and managing mailboxes.

Remember to secure your mail server by implementing proper firewall rules, enabling SSL/TLS encryption, and configuring spam filters to minimize unwanted emails.

Note: Setting up and maintaining a mail server requires technical expertise and careful consideration of security and anti-spam measures. It is recommended to thoroughly research and understand the best practices for mail server administration or seek professional assistance when necessary."

Context: "A user sought instructions on setting up a mail server with Postfix on a personal Ubuntu server, with the domain 'ramsus.lat'. A step-by-step guide was provided, which included: configuring the Ubuntu server, installing and setting up Postfix, establishing DNS records, adjusting the main Postfix configuration file, and restarting Postfix. Setting up mail accounts using tools like Dovecot or Courier was also suggested, and the importance of server security through firewall rules, SSL/TLS encryption, and spam filters was underscored. The complexity of setting up and maintaining a mail server, which necessitates technical expertise and careful attention to security and anti-spam measures, was highlighted."
Make sure to join the new context with the previous one every time mantaining the limit of 500 words and ONLY show the consolidated context including all interactions.
