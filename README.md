# LLM_Autocontext

LLM_Autocontext is a Jupyter Notebook-based project that aims to enhance context-awareness and memory within natural language processing tasks by utilizing two instances of LLM (Like GPT-3) models. This notebook loads the LLM models and passes prompts between them to add context from the previous instance and update the context for subsequent interactions. By incorporating prior knowledge as contextual memory, LLM_Autocontext improves the quality and coherence of generated responses.

## Introduction

In many natural language processing tasks, context plays a crucial role in generating accurate and coherent responses. However, LLM models typically lack an inherent memory mechanism to retain information from previous interactions. LLM_Autocontext addresses this limitation by utilizing a Jupyter Notebook that incorporates context from one LLM instance to another.

By leveraging LLM_Autocontext, you can enhance the context-awareness of LLM models and create more meaningful conversations or coherent text generation. The notebook acts as a bridge between two instances of LLM, where the output of one instance becomes the context for the next, providing a form of memory that informs subsequent responses.

## Installation 
### (Only Template, Nothing here is really working yet)

To use LLM_Autocontext, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone or download the LLM_Autocontext repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLM_Autocontext.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the LLM_Autocontext notebook (LLM_Autocontext.ipynb) from the project directory.

## Usage

To utilize LLM_Autocontext in the Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Open the LLM_Autocontext notebook (LLM_Autocontext.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.

2. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

3. Configure the LLM models:
   - Provide the paths or names of the LLM models in the notebook.
   - Adjust any additional configuration parameters as required.

4. Execute the cells to load the LLM models and define the necessary functions.

5. Set the initial context:
   - Execute the cell to set the initial context as an empty string or a predefined value.

6. Begin the conversation:
   - Execute the cell to prompt the first LLM model with user input.
   - The output of the first LLM model will be used as context for the second LLM model.

7. Iterate the conversation:
   - Execute the cells to pass prompts between the LLM models, updating the context as needed.
   - Capture and display the responses generated by the LLM models.

8. Repeat step 7 for subsequent interactions, allowing the context to evolve and improve responses.

9. Customize and experiment with the notebook to suit your specific needs and use cases.

## Examples

Here's an example conversation using the

 LLM_Autocontext notebook:

```
User: Can you tell me a joke?
System: Sure, here's a joke: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!
User: Haha, that's a good one! Tell me another joke.
System: Of course! Here's another joke: Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts!
User: That's hilarious! I want to share this with my friend. What was the first joke again?
System: The first joke was: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!
```

In this example, the first LLM model generates a joke response, which becomes the context for the second LLM model. The second model generates another joke, and the context is updated. Finally, the user requests to recall the first joke, and the updated context is utilized to provide the requested information.

Please note that this example is simplified, and the actual conversation flow and prompts may vary based on your implementation and specific LLM models.
